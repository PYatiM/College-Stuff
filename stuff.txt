Commonly Utilized Features in Existing Projects

IPFS for decentralized storage of credential data (like certificate files, documents, metadata)
Blockchain (usually Ethereum or similar) for immutability and verification via smart contracts
QR code generation for easy verification by third parties
NFTs or tokenized certificates representing credentials
Role-based access control (issuers, holders, verifiers)
Wallet-based authentication for users (e.g., MetaMask)
Web and mobile interfaces for issuing and verifying credentials
Basic revocation mechanisms for invalidating credentials
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) in some cases for identity management

Features or Applications Often Not or Rarely Utilized

Advanced Privacy-Preserving Technologies
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) beyond simple verification (only some like Verifi-Chain use zkEVM smart contracts)
Homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party computation for privacy-preserving credential sharing
Differential privacy techniques to protect user data from metadata analysis
AI or Machine Learning Integration
Automated fraud detection via AI analyzing credential metadata or usage patterns
Smart matching and verification beyond static credential data
Interoperability Across Multiple Blockchains or Credential Standard
Cross-chain credential verification
Integration with international standards like W3C Verifiable Credentials or OpenBadges in a fully decentralized manner
Real-Time Credential Updates and Lifecycle Management
Dynamic credential updates (e.g., ongoing course progress or cumulative skill tracking)
Automated expiry and renewal workflows beyond basic alerts
Integration with Offline or Physical World Credentials
NFC or smart card integration for offline credential verification
Biometric verification linked with decentralized credentials
User-Centric Data Portability and Control
Fully decentralized identity management with user consent-driven sharing controls (beyond role-based access)
Data portability standards that enable easy migration between platforms
Governance and Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Models
Community-driven governance of credential standards or issuance policies
Token-based incentives for verifiers or issuers
Scalable Layer-2 or Alternative Blockchain Solutions
Use of highly scalable layer-2 solutions for faster and cheaper transactions (beyond just Ethereum mainnet or basic L2s)
